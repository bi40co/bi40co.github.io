        <h1>Welcome to My E-Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my cybersecurity e-portfolio! Here, I showcase projects that demonstrate my skills in network security, cryptography, and Python-based security tools. As I progress on my journey toward Security+ certification, this portfolio reflects my commitment to mastering cybersecurity.</p>

        <h2>1. Key-Logger Project</h2>
        <p>The Key-logger project is a Python-based tool designed to monitor and record keystrokes in real time. This project highlights my ability to work with the Python <code>pynput</code> library and logging techniques, creating an effective method for tracking keyboard input for security analysis.</p>
