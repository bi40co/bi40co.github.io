#WI-FI VULNERABILITY SCANNING PROJECT


##1. Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze the security vulnerabilities of a wireless network using packet capture tools and scanning techniques. The focus was on identifying open networks, weak encryption, and other security flaws in Wi-Fi networks.

1.1. Tools Used:
	•	Wireshark: For capturing network packets and analyzing network traffic.

This project helped in understanding how attackers can monitor and capture Wi-Fi traffic, and how to protect wireless networks from such attacks.



##2. Setup and Tools

To carry out the WiFi Vulnerability Scanning, the following steps were taken to prepare the environment:

2.1. Wireshark Installation:

	•	Wireshark was downloaded and installed from its official website. This tool was used to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time.

2.2. WiFi Interface Configuration:

	•	The wireless interface of the machine was identified and set up for monitoring network traffic using Wireshark’s interface. The Wi-Fi (en0) interface was selected for capturing packets on the network.


2.3. Network Setup:

	•	The scan was performed while connected to a personal mobile hotspot, allowing Wireshark to capture traffic between the laptop and the mobile network. This environment simulated a typical WiFi network setup.


##3. Packet Capture and Analysis Process 

In this step, we’ll document the actual process of capturing and analyzing packets using Wireshark.

Packet Capture and Analysis Process

3.1. Starting the Capture:

	•	After selecting the Wi-Fi (en0) interface in Wireshark, the packet capture was initiated by clicking the start capture button (represented by a blue shark fin icon). Wireshark immediately began capturing all network packets being transmitted over the personal mobile hotspot connection between the laptop and the mobile network.

3.2. Real-time Monitoring:

	•	As packets were captured, they were displayed in real-time within Wireshark. Each packet was detailed with information such as the source, destination, protocol, and additional data. Packets related to protocols like HTTP, DNS, TCP, and ARP were observed.

3.3. Applying Filters:

	•	To focus on specific types of traffic, filters were applied. For instance:
	◦	HTTP traffic was isolated using the filter: http
	◦	DNS requests were filtered using: dns
	◦	This allowed for a more focused analysis of relevant traffic types.

3.4. Stopping the Capture:

	•	After gathering sufficient data, the capture was stopped by clicking the stop capture button (red square icon).

3.5. Initial Analysis:

	•	Captured packets were inspected for vulnerabilities, such as unencrypted traffic and potential security weaknesses. Wireshark’s detailed packet views were used to identify any suspicious or vulnerable traffic within the personal mobile hotspot connection.



##4: Findings and Vulnerabilities

4.1. No Unencrypted Traffic:

	•	During the analysis of the personal mobile hotspot connection, no instances of unencrypted HTTP traffic were observed. This indicates that the data transmitted over the hotspot was either using encrypted protocols (such as HTTPS) or was not exposed to any vulnerabilities during the scan.

4.2. DNS Requests:

	•	DNS traffic was captured, revealing the domain names being requested by devices connected to the hotspot. While DNS queries themselves are not inherently harmful, they could be exploited by an attacker for DNS spoofing or phishing attacks if the network were compromised.

4.3. Encryption Strength:

	•	The mobile hotspot was using WPA2 encryption, which is a strong encryption standard for securing WiFi networks. This provided adequate protection for the devices connected to the hotspot, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

4.4. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Potential:

	•	Since no unencrypted traffic was detected, the risk of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks was lower. However, it’s important to note that MITM attacks are still possible on any network where an attacker can intercept and alter traffic, especially if weak or outdated encryption methods are used.



##5: Prevention Measures and Conclusion 

5.1. Prevention Measures

To further protect against potential vulnerabilities in a Wi-Fi network, even when no direct threats were observed, the following best practices are recommended:

5.1.1. Use HTTPS Everywhere:

	•	Ensure that all websites accessed through the network use HTTPS, which encrypts web traffic. While no HTTP traffic was detected in this scan, enforcing HTTPS remains an important security measure for preventing potential exposure of sensitive data.

5.1.2. Maintain Strong Encryption:

	•	Continue using strong encryption standards like WPA2 or WPA3 on Wi-Fi networks. In this case, the mobile hotspot was secured with WPA2, which provided a high level of protection.

5.1.3. Use a VPN for Additional Security:

	•	Even though no vulnerabilities were detected in this scan, using a VPN adds an extra layer of security by encrypting all internet traffic. This is particularly useful on public networks or hotspots where users may not have full control over the network’s security.

5.1.4. Monitor DNS Traffic:

	•	Keep an eye on DNS traffic, as attackers can exploit DNS for phishing or spoofing attacks. Regular monitoring can help identify any suspicious or unexpected DNS queries.

5.2. Conclusion

This WiFi Vulnerability Scanning project demonstrated the importance of monitoring network traffic, even on seemingly secure connections like personal mobile hotspots. While no unencrypted traffic was observed during the scan, the project highlighted the value of using tools like Wireshark to ensure that encryption standards like WPA2 are in place and that HTTPS is used consistently. Maintaining strong encryption and using a VPN further reduces the risk of unauthorized access or data interception.
